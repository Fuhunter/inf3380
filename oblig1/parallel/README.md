### Code Structure

Process 0 is used as a master, with the remaining process (at least 2) called workers. The master
only delegates work to the workers, and collects the results in the end. This seperation is done
to get a clearer code (IMO).

### Credit
Code design is inspired by looking at [this](https://github.com/jvbrink/coursework/tree/master/INF3380/oblig1) repository,
as well as the guidelines in the [exercise text](../exercise_text.pdf).
